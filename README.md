# First Aid
There is no home without a first aid kit, so why should a home assistant not have one too? 
First aid is a medical assistant that inquires about your current situation and provides medical advice accordingly. A user could be suffering from anything to a paper cut to a full blown panic attack, our application guarantees a first response with insightful tips and resources in the form of a conversation with the Google home assistant.
